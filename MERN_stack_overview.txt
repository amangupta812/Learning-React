# MERN Stack Overview

The MERN stack is a popular web development stack that consists of four main technologies:

1. **MongoDB**:
   - A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
   - It allows for easy scalability and is designed to handle large volumes of data.
   - MongoDB is used to store application data and can be queried using JavaScript.

2. **Express.js**:
   - A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs.
   - It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, including routing, middleware support, and more.
   - Express.js is used to handle HTTP requests and responses, making it a crucial part of the server-side logic.

3. **React**:
   - A front-end library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces.
   - It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the application state efficiently.
   - React is used to build dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) that provide a smooth user experience.

4. **Node.js**:
   - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side.
   - It is event-driven and non-blocking, making it suitable for building scalable network applications.
   - Node.js is used to run the Express server and handle backend logic.

## How They Work Together:
- The MERN stack allows developers to use JavaScript for both the client-side and server-side, providing a seamless development experience.
- MongoDB stores the application's data, which can be accessed and manipulated through Express.js routes.
- React communicates with the Express server to fetch and display data, creating a dynamic user experience.
- Node.js serves as the runtime environment for the server, enabling the execution of JavaScript code on the backend.

This stack is widely used for building modern web applications due to its flexibility, scalability, and the ability to use a single programming language (JavaScript) throughout the entire development process.
